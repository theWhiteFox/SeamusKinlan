      <h3>When it Comes to Christmas Trees, is Real Better Than Fake? That is the Question!</h3>

      <p>As Christmas approaches, people’s thoughts turn to buying presents, arranging to visit family and getting a Christmas
        tree. For many individuals, it doesn’t really feel like the holidays until a tree is put up, and decorating the tree
        is a tradition for numerous families. People have the option of buying a real tree, but many individuals are now
        looking to artificial trees as well. There are numerous advantages of artificial trees, including the long-term cost
        and the fact that they are allergen free. However, nothing is perfect, so people may miss the piney scent that a
        real tree offers and the process of picking out a real tree. To help you decide which type of tree to get, here are
        some of the pros and cons of buying an artificial tree this Christmas.</p>
      <h3>Cons of a Fake Christmas
      Tree:</h3>
      <h4>No Pine Tree Smell</h4>
      <p>
        One of the biggest advantages that real trees have over artificial trees is the amazing pine smell that real trees produce.
        However, there are now sprays that you can buy that will help to make your artificial tree smell like the real thing.
        <h4>Picking Out A Tree Isn’t The Same</h4>
        <p>
          Many people enjoy the process of going out and finding the perfect tree and bringing it home. If you buy an artificial tree,
          you’re not going to have the same feeling of going through tree after tree on a winter evening and finding the
          exact one you want. On the other hand, you may consider this a hassle, so it could make an artificial tree even
          more attractive to you.</p>
        <h4>Artificial Trees Can Still Be Flammable</h4>
        <p>
          While there’s no question that real Christmas trees can be a potential fire hazard, some individuals may be surprised to
          hear that artificial trees may also present the same issue. The good news is many artificial trees now are made
          with fire retardant materials, so if this is a concern for you, be sure to pick a tree that is Inherently Fire
          Retardant.
        </p>
        <h3>Pros of an Artificial Christmas Tree:</h3>
        <h4>Long-term Costs Are Lower </h4>

        <p>
          Even a relatively cheap Christmas tree can cost &euro;40, and prices can go up substantially from there. While real Christmas
          trees are one use only, artificial trees can be used over and over, sometimes for decades. Even if you purchase
          an extravagant artificial Christmas tree, it’s something that you can get years of use out of. </p>
        <h4>Allergen Free Artificial</h4>
        <p>
          Christmas trees are a major relief to people who suffer from allergies. Live trees tend be breeding grounds for mold and
          mildew, especially since they have to be watered regularly to keep from drying out while in your home. On the other
          hand, artificial trees are totally allergen free, unlike real trees, which can cause major problems for people
          with asthma or other respiratory problems.
          <h4>Maintenance and Cleanup Are A Breeze</h4>
          <p>
            One of the reasons that real Christmas trees smell so good is their pine needles, but these same needles are a major headache.
            Needles tend to shed all over the place while you are bringing in a tree, setting it up and especially when you
            are removing it after the holidays are over. You also need to be sure to water the tree or it will start to dry
            out quickly, causing needles to shed at an even faster rate. Artificial trees, of course, have no such issues,
            and they don’t require any special attention once they’re up and decorated.</p>
          <h4>Pre-decorated and Whimsical Trees</h4>
          <p>
            While real trees are gorgeous, you’re not likely to find anything but a green and bare tree for sale. However, there are
            a wide variety of unique artificial Christmas trees for sale. Whether you want a tree that’s pink, upside-down,
            covered in snow or that features LED lights, you can find an artificial version of it. Additionally, if you enjoy
            how festive a decorated tree makes your home but aren’t thrilled about going through the decorating process,
            pre-decorated artificial trees are also available.</p>
          <p>
            Whichever type of Christmas tree you ultimately choose, be sure to follow all safety guidelines to ensure an accident free
            holiday season.</p>
